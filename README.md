# E-Commerce Website with Sign-up Form and FAQs

This repository contains the source code for a simple e-commerce website designed using HTML and CSS. The webpage features a navigation bar, a sign-up form on the right side, and a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) on the left side.

## Description:

- **HTML Code**: The `index.html` file contains the structure of the webpage. It includes a navigation bar (`nav` element), a container (`div` element) divided into two sections: the sign-up form container and the FAQs container. The sign-up form is built using various form controls such as input fields, radio buttons, a select dropdown, and a textarea. The FAQs are displayed as a list of questions and answers using `div` elements.

- **CSS Code**: The styling for the webpage is defined in the `zunaisha_ecommerce.css` file. It includes styling for the navigation bar, form container, form controls, buttons, FAQs container, and individual FAQ items. The layout is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, with appropriate margins, padding, font sizes, and colors.

## Usage:

To view the webpage, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Ensure that the `zunaisha_ecommerce.css` file is in the same directory as the HTML file to apply the necessary styles.
